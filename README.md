On the first page, we run a simple introduction to our application. There are links to each country's Covid data in the top banner.

First is the daily new case of the whole country. The histogram includes data for the past 15 days to show the trend.

This chart shows the daily new case. The number is separate as different age groups. Different colours were used to represent whether the patient is PCR confirmed. The demonstration of charts and data source page is linked below.

The second chart uses a radar map to show the vaccination situation in Australia. The yellow line represents the population of each state, the blue one indicates the number of people getting two shots, and the green one means the number of people getting a booster. The specific number of each situation will occur if the user hovers their mouse on the lines.

The third chart uses a calendar map combined with heat distribution to show the monthly case numbers. Each grid will show a different colour based on the case number. The specific number of each grid will occur if the user hovers their mouse on the lines.
